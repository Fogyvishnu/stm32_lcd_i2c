# STM32 I2C LCD Library (HAL-Based)

This is a lightweight and portable library to interface HD44780-compatible LCD modules using an I2C backpack (PCF8574) with STM32 microcontrollers. It is written using the STM32 HAL library and is designed to work across STM32 L4, F4, F1, and other series by simply changing the included device header (e.g., stm32l4xx_hal.h, stm32f1xx_hal.h, etc.).
